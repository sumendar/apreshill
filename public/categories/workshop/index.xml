      <description>Registration is now open for my 1.5-day workshop on deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow using R.
It will take place on July 5th &amp;amp; 6th in Münster, Germany.

 
You can read about one participant’s experience in my last workshop:
 Big Data – a buzz word you can find everywhere these days, from nerdy blogs to scientific research papers and even in the news. But how does Big Data Analysis work, exactly?</description>

      <description>You can now book me and my 1-day workshop on deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow using R.
In my workshop, you will learn
the basics of deep learningwhat cross-entropy and loss isabout activation functionshow to optimize weights and biases with backpropagation and gradient descenthow to build (deep) neural networks with Keras and TensorFlowhow to save and load models and model weightshow to visualize models with TensorBoardhow to make predictions on test dataDate and place depend on who and how many people are interested, so please contact me either directly or via the workshop page:https://www.</description>
