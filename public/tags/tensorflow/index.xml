      <title>Explaining Keras image classification models with lime</title>

      <description>Last week I published a blog post about how easy it is to train image classification models with Keras.
What I did not show in that post was how to use the model for making predictions. This, I will do here. But predictions alone are boring, so I’m adding explanations for the predictions using the lime package.
I have already written a few blog posts (here, here and here) about LIME and have given talks (here and here) about it, too.</description>

 You can listen to the podcast here.
 In this episode, i’m joined by Rachel Thomas, founder and researcher at Fast AI. If you’re not familiar with Fast AI, the company offers a series of courses including Practical Deep Learning for Coders, Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders and Rachel’s Computational Linear Algebra course.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s that easy! Image classification with keras in roughly 100 lines of code.</title>

      <description>I’ve been using keras and TensorFlow for a while now - and love its simplicity and straight-forward way to modeling. As part of the latest update to my Workshop about deep learning with R and keras I’ve added a new example analysis:
Building an image classifier to differentiate different types of fruits
And I was (again) suprised how fast and easy it was to build the model; it took not even half an hour and only around 100 lines of code (counting only the main code; for this post I added comments and line breaks to make it easier to read)!</description>

      <description>On May 21st and 22nd, I had the honor of having been chosen to attend the rOpenSci unconference 2018 in Seattle. It was a great event and I got to meet many amazing people!
rOpenSci rOpenSci is a non-profit organisation that maintains a number of widely used R packages and is very active in promoting a community spirit around the R-world. Their core values are to have open and reproducible research, shared data and easy-to-use tools and to make all this accessible to a large number of people.</description>

      <description>On April 4th, 2018 I gave a talk about Deep Learning with Keras at the Ruhr.Py Meetup in Essen, Germany. The talk was not specific to Python, though - so if you’re intersted: the slides can be found here: https://www.slideshare.net/ShirinGlander/ruhrpy-introducing-deep-learning-with-keras-and-python

      <description>Recently, I announced my workshop on Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow.
The next dates for it are January 18th and 19th in Solingen, Germany.
You can register now by following this link:https://www.codecentric.de/schulung/deep-learning-mit-keras-und-tensorflow
If any non-German-speaking people want to attend, I’m happy to give the course in English!
Contact me if you have further questions.
As a little bonus, I am also sharing my sketch notes from a Podcast I listened to when first getting into Keras:</description>
