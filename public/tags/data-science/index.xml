      <description>Registration is now open for my 1.5-day workshop on deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow using R.
It will take place on July 5th &amp;amp; 6th in Münster, Germany.

 
You can read about one participant’s experience in my last workshop:
 Big Data – a buzz word you can find everywhere these days, from nerdy blogs to scientific research papers and even in the news. But how does Big Data Analysis work, exactly?</description>

      <description>I have written another blogpost about Looking beyond accuracy to improve trust in machine learning at my company codecentric&amp;rsquo;s blog:
 Traditional machine learning workflows focus heavily on model training and optimization; the best model is usually chosen via performance measures like accuracy or error and we tend to assume that a model is good enough for deployment if it passes certain thresholds of these performance criteria. Why a model makes the predictions it makes, however, is generally neglected.</description>

      <description>Recently, I announced my workshop on Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow.
The next dates for it are January 18th and 19th in Solingen, Germany.
You can register now by following this link:https://www.codecentric.de/schulung/deep-learning-mit-keras-und-tensorflow
If any non-German-speaking people want to attend, I’m happy to give the course in English!
Contact me if you have further questions.
As a little bonus, I am also sharing my sketch notes from a Podcast I listened to when first getting into Keras:</description>

      <description>Last night, the MünsteR R user-group had another great meetup:
Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Assistant Professor at the University of Twente, presented her R package mice about Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations.
It was a very interesting talk and here are my sketchnotes that I took during it:

      <title>How to combine point and boxplots in timeline charts with ggplot2 facets</title>
      <link>/2017/11/combine_point_boxplot_ggplot/</link>

      <guid>/2017/11/combine_point_boxplot_ggplot/</guid>
      <description>In a recent project, I was looking to plot data from different variables along the same time axis. The difficulty was, that some of these variables I wanted to have as point plots, while others I wanted as box-plots.
Because I work with the tidyverse, I wanted to produce these plots with ggplot2. Faceting was the obvious first step but it took me quite a while to figure out how to best combine facets with point plots (where I have one value per time point) with and box-plots (where I have multiple values per time point).</description>

      <title>Explore Predictive Maintenance with flexdashboard</title>

      <description>I have written the following post about Predictive Maintenance and flexdashboard at my company codecentric’s blog:
Predictive Maintenance is an increasingly popular strategy associated with Industry 4.0; it uses advanced analytics and machine learning to optimize machine costs and output (see Google Trends plot below).A common use-case for Predictive Maintenance is to proactively monitor machines, so as to predict when a check-up is needed to reduce failure and maximize performance.</description>

      <title>Blockchain &amp; distributed ML - my report from the data2day conference</title>

      <description>Yesterday and today I attended the data2day, a conference about Big Data, Machine Learning and Data Science in Heidelberg, Germany. Topics and workshops covered a range of topics surrounding (big) data analysis and Machine Learning, like Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, TensorFlow applications, etc. Distributed systems and scalability were a major part of a lot of the talks as well, reflecting the growing desire to build bigger and more complex models that can’t (or would take too long to) run on a single computer.</description>
